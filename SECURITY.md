# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please **do not open a public issue** with vulnerability details. Report it
privately to the maintainers of
[andres18113/cisco-muejeje](https://github.com/andres18113/cisco-muejeje) through
GitHub's private vulnerability reporting: open the repository's **Security** tab
and choose **Report a vulnerability**. If that option is not available, open an
issue that only asks for a private contact channel and leaves out the technical
details.

The goal is coordinated disclosure, with a fix available before details are
published. If you want a CVE, say so in the report.

## Threat model — read this before you file anything

Cisco-Muejeje is a **single-user desktop tool**. It runs on your machine, it
drives a copy of Cisco Packet Tracer that you opened, and it has no server, no
accounts and no data belonging to anyone else. Several things that look alarming
are the actual design:

- **`pt_send_raw` executes arbitrary JavaScript inside Packet Tracer.** It is
  registered only when the server starts with
  `PT_MCP_PUBLIC_SURFACE=developer-capability-investigation`; the default
  `enterprise` surface does not expose it. When it is registered, arbitrary
  execution is its stated purpose: an escape hatch for anything the typed tools
  don't cover. PT's `runCode` is `new Function(scriptText)`, so this is full code
  execution in PT's script engine, by design.
- **Every tool that builds a topology ultimately generates JavaScript** that PT
  executes. The MCP server is a code generator pointed at a script engine; that
  is the whole architecture.
- **`output_dir` writes where you tell it to.** It is an explicit parameter on
  the export tools. Project names and device names are confined *within* that
  directory, but the directory itself is your choice.
- **The bridge is a local HTTP server on `127.0.0.1`.** Any process running as
  your user can reach it. It requires a token (below), but a process running as
  you can read that token file — just as it could read Packet Tracer's memory.

**Run this on a machine you trust, against topologies you trust.** An LLM driving
these tools is, by construction, executing code in PT on your behalf. Prompt
injection in something the model reads is a real risk and this tool cannot
defend against it for you.

## What is in scope

Things worth reporting, with the bar being "this breaks an expectation the
design actually makes":

- Reaching the bridge **without the token** — from a web page, another origin,
  or any path that bypasses the check. This is the one that matters most.
- The bridge binding to anything other than loopback.
- The token leaking: into logs, into tool output that isn't explicitly marked as
  secret-bearing, into files readable by other users.
- Escaping the output directory: any `project_name`, device name or plan field
  that writes, reads or deletes outside the base directory.
- Injection through a *typed* tool — a value that reaches PT's script engine as
  code, or a device's IOS config as extra commands, when the tool's contract
  says it is data. Device names, hostnames, banners, ACL remarks and VLAN names
  are data.
- Anything that lets a **remote** party reach any part of this.

`pt_send_raw` doing what `pt_send_raw` says it does is not a finding.

## How the bridge is protected

The bridge is a local HTTP server that Packet Tracer polls for JavaScript to
run. Binding to `127.0.0.1` is **not** sufficient protection and was never the
control: a `POST` with `Content-Type: text/plain` is a CORS-simple request, so
any web page in any browser on the host can send one. CORS stops the attacker
reading the response — and an injection never needed to read anything.

What actually protects it is a shared secret:

- A 256-bit random token is generated on first run and stored under
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\packet-tracer-mcp\bridge_token` (or `$XDG_STATE_HOME` on
  POSIX). It is random, not derived: this repository is public and an attacker
  runs on the same host, so anything computed from the clock or other public
  inputs would be equally computable by them.
- Every endpoint except `/ping` requires it.
- `/ping` is unauthenticated on purpose, so port conflicts can be diagnosed
  before you know who owns the port. It returns only a one-way fingerprint of
  the token, never the token.
- The Packet Tracer extension reads the token **from the file**, through PT's
  Script Engine (`ipc.systemFileManager`). The token is never served over HTTP
  and there is no pairing step, so there is no window in which another local
  client could claim it.
- `Host` is validated against loopback, which blocks DNS rebinding.

You can override the token with `PT_MCP_BRIDGE_TOKEN` for tests and CI.

## Supported versions

Cisco-Muejeje has not tagged any releases. Security fixes are made on the
current development line, and there are no maintained release branches. The
package version `0.8.0` is inherited from upstream.

Code older than upstream **v0.6.0** has an unauthenticated bridge: any web page
you visited while Packet Tracer was open could execute code inside it. Do not run
it.
