Offline after the World-B implementation: **2718 passed / 0 failed** with the
checkout-local `.venv` and a writable, gitignored pytest basetemp. The failed
Floor-1 run cleaned every owned device and independently re-observed the empty
semantic workspace twice. Packet Tracer is open; its workspace is empty.

The World-B source/test changes described below are not yet checkpointed in this
paragraph's HEAD. Commit and push them before the next LIVE mutation.

## Decisive powered-phone measurement -- World A refuted

FACT: the read defect was fixed first and alone in `8d594994`: the voice SVI is
read with `isDhcpClientOn`, while the device-level absence remains `None`.

FACT: the next governed run mechanically established build `9.0.1.0858`, the
checkout-local production namespace, authenticated fresh HTTP, two complete
zero-device semantic inventories, and `safe_for_disposable_mutation=True`.

FACT: on the 21 powered Cisco 7960 phones in real Floor 1:

```text
VOICE_INTERFACE_PRESENT = 21
VOICE_INTERFACE_DHCP_READABLE = 21
VOICE_INTERFACE_DHCP_TRUE = 21
VOICE_INTERFACE_DHCP_FALSE = 0
VOICE_INTERFACE_DHCP_UNOBSERVABLE = 0
VOICE_INTERFACE_ADDRESS_CHANNEL = 21
VOICE_INTERFACE_ADDRESSED = 0
VOICE_DEVICE_DHCP = unreadable:21
```

FACT: the stage then observed all 21 phones without an IPv4 address. It failed
after the configured 180-second voice convergence window because 19 complete
`show ephone` rows remained `UNREGISTERED`; extensions 3001 and 3007 were absent
from the complete five-page table and therefore remained `UNOBSERVABLE`.

FACT: the runner exited by its own governed failure path. Cleanup was VERIFIED;
both fresh post-cleanup inventories were observed and contained zero semantic
devices.

CONCLUSION: `setDhcpClientFlag(true)` is forbidden on this evidence. No phone
acquisition action was added. World A is refuted and World B is primary.

## World B -- typed VLAN traversal observation

The independent source audit confirmed:

* FACT: `TrunkStatusRow` and `parse_show_interfaces_trunk` discarded the allowed,
  active, and STP-forwarding VLAN sections.
* FACT: `_verify_trunk` hard-coded `allowed_vlans=UNOBSERVABLE` while declaring
  the trunk verified.
* FACT: `SHOW_INTERFACES_TRUNK` was registered but not pagination-qualified.
* INCOMPLETE: no retained raw transcript proved the historical claim that those
  sections paged away on every relevant switch. The source risk was real; the
  universal LIVE claim was not accepted.

The minimum typed implementation now:

* preserves `None` (section absent), `()` (IOS explicitly said `none`), and a
  populated VLAN tuple as distinct states;
* captures the registered query through its bounded pager until a prompt;
* independently verifies the expected VLAN set in `allowed`, `active`, and
  `forwarding/not pruned` for each configured trunk;
* fails on an observed omission and remains `UNOBSERVABLE` on absent/incomplete
  evidence;
* records named per-device/per-interface traversal evidence in the governed
  runner.

FAIL-FIRST: four targeted regressions failed against the old code (two missing
row fields, one false VERIFIED result, one truncated pager result). Focused:
12 passed. Affected files: 101 passed. Full: 2718 passed / 0 failed.

Topology worth remembering: the 23 PCs that lease are all on **Switch4**; all 21
phones are on **Switch5**, one hop further out, and everything else on Switch5 is
static or not addressable, so that hop has never been proven to forward DHCP.

The next governed Floor-1 journal will name these five exact trunk endpoints,
each expecting VLANs 10/20/30:

```text
Switch10 GigabitEthernet0/1 <-> Router4 FastEthernet0/0
Switch10 FastEthernet0/1    <-> Switch4 GigabitEthernet0/1
Switch4  GigabitEthernet0/2 <-> Switch5 GigabitEthernet0/1
```

FACT: `show ip dhcp binding` has **no registered query**. `OperationalQueryId`
carries `SHOW_IP_DHCP_SNOOPING` only, which is switch security, not the server
binding table. Re-audit this immediately before adding anything, and consider it
only if fresh trunk traversal evidence is still insufficient.

## NEXT_ACTIVE_STEP

1. Commit and push the World-B implementation; require a clean exact upstream
   HEAD before LIVE.
2. Re-run governed routing-core -> router4-switch10 -> Floor 1 without stopping
   a stage mid-flight.
3. Read `trunk_vlan_traversal` from the durable Floor-1 journal. In particular,
   require VLAN 20 to be VERIFIED as allowed, active, and forwarding on both
   ends of Switch4 <-> Switch5.
4. If any row observably omits VLAN 20, root-cause that typed contradiction.
   If the registered trunk evidence is absent/incomplete, do not infer.
5. Only if the complete path is verified yet the phones remain unaddressed,
   independently audit and then add the smallest registered DHCP-server binding
   observation. Do not confuse it with DHCP snooping.

Do not wire any new DHCP observation into `VerificationKind.DHCP_POOL`: the
ceiling at `qualify_cp_scale_live.py:625` enforces status UNOBSERVABLE +
`fresh_evidence` False + evidence_method `runtime_observability_limit` + every
field UNOBSERVABLE. New observations must be additive or the governed gate
rejects them.

## Bridge lifecycle -- PARTIAL PASS, still APPLIED NOT VERIFIED

`4c881d5` rechains the webview command poll past everything that can throw and
adds a watchdog above it, after the blocker reproduced with the recorded
signature (`last_poll_ago: None`, `unauth_count: 0`, file bridge alive, token
unchanged). Root cause was `log()` throwing inside `x.onload` before the
rechain, while `pollBridgeStatus`'s own interval kept the UI looking healthy.

FACT: a full Floor-1 run completed afterwards and the bridge stayed fresh; three
further HTTP sessions connected cleanly; no duplicate polling or execution.

FACT, fresh run at `78996aa`: authenticated HTTP connected with a fresh poll,
remained connected at both governed resume gates, and surfaced no transport
failure during the complete Floor-1 deployment and 180-second voice observation.
The runner then stopped its transport normally after its governed voice failure
and verified cleanup. A subsequent fresh session remains part of the next LIVE
preflight; the currently loaded webview source is still not independently
identifiable from Python.

UNOBSERVABLE: whether Packet Tracer has actually **loaded** the patched
`interface.js`. Nothing readable from Python distinguishes the patched loop from
the old one while both are healthy. Confirm by reloading the extension and
watching for the watchdog log line, or by inspecting the loaded source.

Diagnose a failure with:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src .venv/Scripts/python.exe -c \
  "from packet_tracer_mcp.infrastructure.execution.live_bridge import PacketTracerHttpTransport as T; \
   from packet_tracer_mcp.application.use_cases.qualify_cp_scale_live import canonical_bridge_polling_error; \
   t=T(); print('connected:', t.start(timeout_seconds=20.0)); \
   print(canonical_bridge_polling_error(t.status_dict()) or '(nothing to diagnose)'); t.stop()"
```

Never repoint the runner at the file bridge to get past it. The file bridge is
alive in every one of these failures -- it runs in the Script Engine with no
window, while this channel lives in the webview.

## Secondary anomalies -- recorded, not chased

* Complete 5-page `show ephone` captures name **19 of 21** ephones; `3001`
  (ephone-1) and `3007` (ephone-7) absent, reproduced in 2 of 3 complete
  captures. All 21 bindings applied, none refused. A duplicate MAC from
  `_phone_mac` is a HYPOTHESIS, not a finding.
* The raw capture is still not retained in the evidence. Retaining it is the
  cheapest next step on that question -- parsed verdicts cannot say why a row is
  missing, only that it is.
* Capture completeness is flaky run to run (complete / truncated / complete /
  truncated), always fail-closed, never fabricating absence.

Do not chase these ahead of acquisition: a phone with no address cannot register,
so that table stays UNREGISTERED regardless.

## Driving the live runner

This session used the persistent runner directly and left it waiting at each
explicit checkpoint while the Git commit/push was performed externally. No
scratchpad driver was relied upon or verified from this worktree.

Do not edit tracked files under `src/`, `tests/`,
`tools/cp_scale_canonical_live.py` or the two reference documents while a run is
in flight: the checkpoint refuses to advance if governed source changed.
`EXTENSION/` is not governed source.

**Do not stop a run mid-flight.** Physical ownership is runtime-instance-local by
design, so a killed run leaves its devices behind with no governed way to clean
them up.

A Floor-1 run now costs about seven minutes end to end. That is what makes
iterating on this cheap, and it is why the registration table is read once per
call control instead of once per phone.
